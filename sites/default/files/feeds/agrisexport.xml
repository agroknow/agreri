	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Increasingly, cooperatives in the agribusiness are being confronted with the globalization of agri-food markets. Cooperatives adapt to this development by internationalizing their activities. This paper presents a method of measuring the degree of internationalization (DoI) and its application to European cooperatives in the dairy sector. Then, the financial performance of these cooperatives is measured by applying balance sheet analysis. The paper ends with a discussion of why German cooperatives are noticeably less internationalized and show weaker financial performance than their European competitors.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Approximately 13% of cooperatives surveyed carry PDDAs, typically fruit cooperatives, of which over one-half have no financial protection against large unexpected withdrawals. Cooperatives with PDDAs must be concerned with potential legal conflicts regarding the handling of these accounts, as evidenced by a U.S. Supreme Court case classifying PDDAs as securities. Supply cooperatives are most likely to show investment in other cooperatives as a high percentage of total assets, which could generate insolvency issues for locals.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Analysis of milk marketing institutions and their association with cooperative marketing functions sheds light the interdependency of government involvement in milk marketing. We examine the role of cooperatives to determine whether cooperative market power can substitute for public policy power. The ability of cooperatives to maintain membership and balancing services depends critically on the dairy policies in place today.  In absence of milk marketing orders, we find it likely that cooperatives will be unable to maintain these services.]]></dcterms:abstract>

New organizational institutions have been proposed to overcome the cooperative main weaknesses (the so called new generation cooperatives). In this paper, we provide a simple model based on a financial approach to address the issue of cooperative competitiveness and to assess the investment efficiency of both traditional and new generation cooperatives. The main conclusions of the analysis are: i) cooperatives (both traditional and new generation ones) may have incentive to adopt projects that do not maximize the Net Present Value of the firm ii) the institutions of new generation cooperatives are not sufficient to ensure net present value maximization, even though they address some of the main concerns of traditional cooperatives iii) traditional cooperatives may have a competitive advantage in businesses that require the aggregation of a large number of farmers.]]></dcterms:abstract>

It was also recognized that cooperatives in LDC's could act as an important institutional mechanism for improving the coordination of the food systems in the two accounts.
	The study identified major shortcomings in operational efficiency, the equitable distribution of benefits to members and in the progressiveness of cooperatives in both countries.
	The policy conclusions and recommendations emphasize that (1) the role of the government in rural development programs should be redefined to emphasize a public service role while encouraging a "de-officialization" approach in cooperative development; (2) the cooperative marketing systems should be restructured to allow for a more decentralized system of local marketing cooperatives that can compete effectively with other private sector enterprises; and (3) a reconsideration of the basic foundation of the government promoted cooperatives be made to allow for a more participatory approach to rural development.
	Suggestions for improving the performance of Philippine and Indonesian cooperatives give priority to membership support, capital accumulation, adequate training and education, and organization and management of marketing cooperatives.]]></dcterms:abstract>

We survey 2000 Missouri corn and soybean farmers and find that trust and farmer perceptions of trustworthiness and competence are higher in cooperatives than in investor-owned firms and that trust is a significant factor explaining the choice of farmers to market to cooperatives rather than investor-owned firms.  Interestingly, we find that trust is more significant in producers' decisions for marketing soybeans than for corn.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The emphasis of the paper is on describing the institutional changes in China's agricultural economy and stressing the theoretical reasons why the cooperatives can be an efficient marketing alternative.
	This paper argues that performance of an agricultural marketing and supply cooperative is affected by its internal organization and its external relationships.  These two issues are discussed in some detail with the reference to the situation in China.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Agricultural cooperatives are participating in mergers, acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures at a record pace.  While post-post merger performance has been examined extensively for investor owned firms, this has not been the case for agricultural cooperatives since these firms do not have an explicit profit motive nor publicly traded stock.  Results from a three-stage econometric model reveal that a major motivation for cooperatives to engage in these activities is to circumvent unique capital constraints, thus resulting in improved profitability.  Furthermore, the decision to merge and financial performance are jointly endogenous, with profitability positively influenced and sales growth negatively influenced
by the likelihood of merger.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The empirical results (a) are consistent with predictions from the game theory model of cooperative behavior, (b) reject the null hypothesis of absolute allocative efficiency, and (c) indicate absolute overutilization of capital inputs among the sample cooperatives.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Small-scale (communal) farmers in South Africa have limited access to factors of production, credit and information, and markets are often constrained by inadequate property rights and high transaction costs. The objective of this research is to investigate whether agricultural cooperatives - considered by the South African (SA) government as organizations that could help promote community and economic development - can facilitate smallholder access to input and product markets that could enhance their development. This paper initially discusses the principles of cooperation, and briefly describes the history and development of agricultural cooperatives in developed and less-developed countries, with an emphasis on the United States and South Africa. A new Cooperatives Act, based on international principles of cooperation, was promulgated in South Africa in August 2005. The theory of cooperatives, and new institutional economics theory (NIE) (including transaction cost economics, agency theory, and property rights theory) and its applicability to the cooperative organizational form, are also presented, as are the inherent problems of traditional cooperatives, namely free-rider, horizon, portfolio, control, and influence cost problems caused by vaguely defined property rights. An analysis of the future of cooperatives in general, based on a NIE approach, suggests a life cycle for cooperatives (formation, growth, reorganization or exit) as they adapt to a changing economic environment characterized by technological change, industrialization of agriculture, and growing individualism.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Few agricultural marketing cooperatives have nationally prominent brand names. Instead, they tend to concentrate in commodity-oriented markets, which can be attributed to the cooperative principlesuser-benefit, user-financed and user-control. However, these structural disadvantages can be overcome. Due to the user-benefit principle, cooperatives often have seasonal product availability and/or limited product lines; they also suffer from the horizon problem, lacking the structure to provide long-term returns to members who invest in brand building. The user-benefit principle can be converted into an advantage by using the cooperative identity as a marketing strategy, and the horizon problem can be remedied by implementing a delivery-rights system. Cooperatives' limited access to capital is attributable to the user-financed principle. Joint ventures, legislative reforms to expand cooperatives' sources of equity capital and preferred stock offerings can be used to overcome this constraint. The homogeneous nature of cooperative boards is attributable to the user-control principle; it gives rise to the principal-agent problem. Forming subsidiaries or joint ventures to market branded products can remedy this situation, with the boards composed of individuals with expertise in branded products.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Cooperative group actions are undergoing a resurgence in popularity in close concert with an increasing awareness of the problems of rural poverty and a belief that group actions can serve as a partial solution to those problems.  There are several elements necessary for the economic success of a cooperative, of which the absence of any one may preclude economic success and thus greatly diminish or eliminate the usefulness of cooperatives as an anti-poverty tool.

This paper examines capital resources as one prerequisite for economic success by reviewing capital needs and capital sources.  The availability of capital as well as the comparative advantages and disadvantages of the various sources are examined as they apply to limited resource cooperatives.  From this discussion general guidelines are drawn for the use of cooperative managers and members engaged in acquiring capital resources and as food for thought for those individuals and agencies involved in promulgating or supporting limited resource cooperative enterprise.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Agricultural cooperatives find it difficult to forecast their interest costs and net income.  If input and output prices are fixed, anticipatory hedging of future interest costs is appropriate.  Banks for Cooperatives obtain funds in maturities longer than the three months of Treasury bills.  Hence, anticipatory hedging of interest rates may require selling a "strip" of more than one Treasury bill futures contract.  Adapting Peck's model of hedges against forecast error, hedge ratios generally exceed one-for-one, "naïve" hedging, with effectiveness generally above 95 percent.  Hedges closed out just before a delivery date have the highest effectiveness.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Sales of goods other than grain, fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, petroleum products, and feed was positively related to overall efficiency. Overall efficiency was significantly correlated with the rate of return to assets.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Over production is a persistent and costly problem in Norwegian agriculture. Support to agricultural production implicitly yields incentives to produce too much, i.e., causing market prices to fall below the target level, and thereby increasing the need for subsidies and additional market interventions. In order to restrict supplies, farmers are allowed to coordinate through marketing cooperatives. The paper argues that this coordination is likely to be insufficient in markets where the cooperative competes with an investor-owned wholesaler. Interventions in the market in order to remove excess supplies may induce further incentives to increase production. Levying a tax on all production in order to cover market regulation costs, moves the solution in the right direction but is impotent in restoring the target (second-best) level of production.]]></dcterms:abstract>

This study reviews the existing status of milk marketing and dairy co-operatives in India and provides recommendations to meet future challenges. The results of the study indicate that 80 percent of the milk produced by the rural producer is handled by an unorganized sector and the remaining 20 percent is handled by an organized sector. It is found that the dairy co-operatives play a vital role in alleviating rural poverty by augmenting rural milk production and marketing. Involvement of intermediaries; lack of bargaining power by the producers; and lack of infrastructure facilities for collection, storage, transportation, and processing are the major constraints which affect the prices received by producers in milk marketing. Milk quality, product development, infrastructure support development, and global marketing are found to be future challenges of India's milk marketing.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The discriminatory pricing policy allows the FDCs to expand their membership by absorbing some of the transportation cost of producers in distant locations that would otherwise be independent producers or members of competing cooperatives.  Spatial pricing policies are analyzed to determine the effects of discriminatory pricing on the blend price, average aggregate revenue of cooperative members, and total costs and quantity of milk imports.  The results of this study show that a nondiscriminatory pricing policy maximizes the cooperative members' blend price and average aggregate revenue.

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This paper compares the traditional forms of capitalization used by American co-ops to newly emerging forms. It is based on an in-depth review of several case co-ops. A broad framework is provided that may be beneficial in more extensive studies of capitalization practices of cooperatives and similar organizations. It is divided into three parts. Part One outlines the alternative capitalization forms being used by cooperatives and their antecedents, where conversions to other structures and forms have occurred. Two basic capitalization forms have been used by cooperatives: traditional (open) and new generation (closed). Cooperatives using both forms have elected to add new capitalization features, such as use of publicly listed stock, or have elected to convert to different forms, such as an LLC or a C corporation. Several perceived advantages have motivated these changes besides the traditional advantages utilized by cooperative corporations, limited liability and single taxation. They include access to capital, liquidity and appreciability of stock. Part Two provides a brief description of the nature and experience of several modern cooperative organizations using the framework presented in Part One. The descriptions are based on in-depth case studies. The case study selections are from a broad cross-section of cooperatives that include the following: (1) Mid-Kansas Cooperative (traditional, centralized, local grain marketing and farm supply using only internally generated equity); (2) Land O'Lakes (traditional, centralized and federated, regional dairy marketing and processing and farm supply using only internally generated equity and registered debt financing); (3) CHS Cooperatives (traditional, primarily federated, regional grain marketing and processing and farm supply, with the recent addition of publicly listed preferred stock); and (4) U.S. Premium Beef (new generation, centralized, regional beef processing using closely held but tradeable common stock and proposal to convert to an LLC with member and non-member tradeable stock). In addition brief mention is made of other cooperatives including (5) Dakota Growers Pasta (new generation, centralized, regional durum wheat processing with recent conversion to C corporation); (6) South Dakota Soybean Processing (new generation, centralized regional soybean processing with conversion to LLC); (7) Pro-Fac and Birds Eye Foods (new generation centralized regional frozen vegetable processing with publicly listed stock and transition of processing entity, Birds Eye, to majority ownership by investor-oriented partner likely to exit through an IPO) and (8) Gold Kist (traditional, centralized regional poultry processing with proposed conversion to publicly traded C corporation).

	<dc:identifier><![CDATA[This paper compares the traditional forms of capitalization used by American co-ops to newly emerging forms. It is based on an in-depth review of several case co-ops. A broad framework is provided that may be beneficial in more extensive studies of capitalization practices of cooperatives and similar organizations. It is divided into three parts. 
Part One outlines the alternative capitalization forms being used by cooperatives and their antecedents, where conversions to other structures and forms have occurred. Two basic capitalization forms have been used by cooperatives: traditional (open) and new generation (closed). Cooperatives using both forms have elected to add new capitalization features, such as use of publicly listed stock, or have elected to convert to different forms, such as an LLC or a C corporation. Several perceived advantages have motivated these changes besides the traditional advantages utilized by cooperative corporations, limited liability and single taxation. They include access to capital, liquidity and appreciability of stock. 
Part Two provides a brief description of the nature and experience of several modern cooperative organizations using the framework presented in Part One. The descriptions are based on in-depth case studies. The case study selections are from a broad cross-section of cooperatives that include the following: (1) Mid-Kansas Cooperative (traditional, centralized, local grain marketing and farm supply using only internally generated equity); (2) Land O'Lakes (traditional, centralized and federated, regional dairy marketing and processing and farm supply using only internally generated equity and registered debt financing); (3) CHS Cooperatives (traditional, primarily federated, regional grain marketing and processing and farm supply, with the recent addition of publicly listed preferred stock); and (4) U.S. Premium Beef (new generation, centralized, regional beef processing using closely held but tradeable common stock and proposal to convert to an LLC with member and non-member tradeable stock). In addition brief mention is made of other cooperatives including (5) Dakota Growers Pasta (new generation, centralized, regional durum wheat processing with recent conversion to C corporation); (6) South Dakota Soybean Processing (new generation, centralized regional soybean processing with conversion to LLC); (7) Pro-Fac and Birds Eye Foods (new generation centralized regional frozen vegetable processing with publicly listed stock and transition of processing entity, Birds Eye, to majority ownership by investor-oriented partner likely to exit through an IPO) and (8) Gold Kist (traditional, centralized regional poultry processing with proposed conversion to publicly traded C corporation). Part Three will briefly outline some of the challenges facing cooperatives in the future with reference to capitalization.]]></dc:identifier>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Cooperatives are not only a legal form, but also a form of organisation, which is owned by a group of individuals. For gaining and sustaining competitiveness cooperatives are forced to grow into certain minimum optimal size categories. Common measures of size are turnover or total assets. But, for cooperatives the number of members has been a quite popular measure for cooperatives' success, size, and their attractiveness. Although often mentioned, the number of members has only been taken as a given value, ignoring the influence of the group itself on its own size. However, there has been no attempt to measure the potential size of a group and its growth dynamic under a given set-up. With the development of a strategic decision game for a hypothetical member, we attempt to show, how the individual member influences the size of his group. Our findings will provide more insight into the overall understanding of cooperatives as a specific organisational and legal form of corporation.


Genossenschaften sind nicht nur eine Rechtsform, sondern gleichzeitig eine Form der Organisation, die durch eine Gruppe von Individuen getragen wird. Für die Behauptung im Wettbewerb wird von Genossenschaften eine bestimmte Mindestgröße verlangt. Als Größenkriterien werden neben den üblichen finanzwirtschaftlichen Kennzahlen  vor allem die Zahl der Mitglieder als Maß ihres Erfolges und ihrer Attraktivität verwendet. Allerdings gab es noch keinen Versuch, die potenzielle Größe und die Wachstumsdynamik einer Gruppe unter festgelegten Bedingungen zu charakterisieren und zu quantifizieren. Anhand eines strategischen Entscheidungsspiels wird gezeigt, wie das einzelne Mitglied die Größe seiner Gruppe beeinflussen kann. Außerdem zeigen wir, dass Gruppenwachstum einen exponentiellen Charakter aufweist. Diese Erkenntnisse sind für das Gesamtverständnis der Genossenschaft als Organisations- und Rechtsform unerlässlich.]]></dcterms:abstract>

A survey was used to obtain information about cooperatives' expenditures to entities within the state during the year 2000; a total of 137 usable surveys were obtained.  The North Dakota Input-Output Model was used to analyze the economic contribution of the cooperatives to the state.  The results indicated that the cooperatives' direct in-state expenditures totaled $1.6 billion in 2000.  The largest expenditure category was the household sector, which comprised payroll, patronage refunds, and stock retirement and accounted for 46 percent of total direct expenditures.   Through the multiplier process, the initial $1.6 billion of direct impacts were estimated to lead to another $3.6 billion in secondary impacts, for a total economic contribution of $5.2 billion.  Cooperative activities resulted in $1.9 billion of additional personal income and $1.2 billion of retail trade activity.  These levels of economic activity were associated with more than $88 million in added state tax revenues.  The cooperatives employed more than 9,000 full-time and 3,000 part-time workers, and the secondary economic effects resulting from their activities resulted in more than 42,000 secondary jobs in other sectors of the state economy.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[After World War II, livestock slaughter decentralized and livestock producers increased direct sales to packers. As a result, livestock producers have been less likely than other agricultural producers to use cooperatives to market their farm production. Between 1994 and 1998, less than 15 percent of livestock and wool production was marketed through cooperatives compared with 80 percent of milk production and 40 to 50 percent of grains and oilseeds. Recent structural change in the livestock and meat industries, however, has renewed interest in marketing cooperatives among livestock producers.In December 1998, the imbalance between market-ready hog supplies and slaughter capacity pushed hog prices to as low as $8 per hundredweight on a live-weight basis. In the wake of these market conditions, the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) formed a Cooperative Task Force to study the potential for a national pork marketing cooperative. The activities of this Task Force lead to the formation of Pork America.Pork America is registered in 20 states and its members represent approximately 10 percent of U.S. hog production. The cooperative's goal is to create a producer-owned and controlled pork production, packing and processing system that will provide increased returns to independent producer members. Pork America is currently in the process of developing business and governance structures and identifying pork processing and marketing opportunities. The formation of Pork America is unique in the history of livestock cooperatives. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first livestock-marketing cooperative that has been organized with a direct nation-wide membership base. In the early part of the 20th century, Saprio fostered fruit, vegetable and specialty cooperatives with a national marketing scope, however production requirements limited membership scope to local or regional production areas. In the 1920s, Saprio's national concept was extended to cotton, tobacco and grain cooperatives, but these efforts collapsed during the depression. Since the 1930s, the scope of most marketing cooperatives has been generally limited to a local or regional membership base. Those cooperatives that have achieved national membership and marketing scale have done so through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, Pork America has had limited resources of experience to draw on. A single-case descriptive case study approach will be used to demonstrate that formation of a pork marketing cooperative with a national membership and marketing scope is a viable alternative to merging local and regional cooperatives to realize the economies of size and scope necessary to compete in the pork industry. The method is appropriate because the industrial environment in which Pork America formed contains qualitative and phenomenal information that can not be clearly separated from the quantitative description of industry structure. The single-case approach is appropriate, because as stated above, Pork America is a unique case of cooperative formation. The case study chronologically describes the formation of Pork America within the context of historical, current, and expected pork industry structure and market conditions. The structural and market conditions demonstrate why the national scope of Pork America is both a viable and desirable achievement. At this point in time, Pork America has not begun operations. Therefore, operational success or failure is unknown.

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Agricultural cooperatives tend to be riskier than investor-oriented firms, both in a business and financial sense. However, cooperative managers are often reluctant to actively manage risk.  Although the risk management irrelevance proposition suggests that cooperative managers should be unable to add shareholder value through risk management activities, this study argues that there are several reasons why this is not likely to be the case for cooperatives. Several empirical examples are provided through numerical simulation of pro-forma financial statements from representative agricultural cooperatives. Using mean variance, expected utility and value-at-risk metrics, the results of these simulations show that various risk management strategies can improve the risk-return profile of a typical cooperative.

This difference results in a difference in manager roles and cooperative firm behavior unless the interdependence and interaction is offset by technological constraints, complexity, product diversity, and rate of change in the environment.

This paper presents a model in which that result fails. Every individual farmer chooses either to join or not join a cooperative depending on whether transactions costs are lower from cooperative membership or nonmembership. As cooperative membership increases, transactions costs for members decline, but for nonmembers these costs increase. Results of this analysis reveal that an equilibrium exists in which all farmers voluntarily choose to join the cooperative, but more than half of the members wish the cooperative had not been formed, and transactions costs in the aggregate are higher with the cooperative then without it.]]></dcterms:abstract>

effect of cooperative involvement on quality- enhancing product innovation activity, the pricing of food
products, and the welfare of the groups involved in the context of a mixed duopoly where an openmembership
consumer co- op competes with an IOF. Analytical results show that the involvement of the
member welfare- maximizing co- op in R&D can be quality and welfare enhancing by increasing the
arrival rate of product innovations and reducing the prices of food products. The effectiveness of the
co- op is shown to depend on the nature of product differentiation and the relative quality of its
products, the degree of consumer heterogeneity, and the size of innovation costs .]]></dcterms:abstract>

This study develops a test for the hypothesis that cooperative consolidation occurs primarily in response to capital constraints associated with a lack of access to external equity capital. An empirical model estimates the shadow value of long-term investment capital within a multinomial logit model of transaction choice in a panel data set of the 100 largest U.S. cooperatives. The results substantially confirm the capital-constraint hypothesis. Thus, the primary implication is that internal growth may be a more viable alternative to consolidation if new forms of cooperative financing are developed.]]></dcterms:abstract>

However, in the literature some studies questioned whether the mixed market structure is a stable equilibrium, and suggestions are made that the cooperatives eventually will crowd out all investor-owned firms. To analyse the problem, the family of models of mixed markets is generalized and analysed. It is shown that a mixed market equilibrium may occur under quite general conditions. Also, it is shown that the investor-owned firm may serve as a yardstick of production to the cooperative, helping farmers achieve an increased payoff relative to a situation with a single coop in the market.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Analytical results show that the involvement of the member welfare-maximizing co-op in R&D can be quality and welfare enhancing by increasing the arrival rate of product innovations and reducing the prices of food products. The effectiveness of the coop is shown to depend on the nature of product differentiation and the relative quality of its products, the degree of consumer heterogeneity, and the size of innovation costs.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This paper examines how ownership structure affects quality choice and the subsequent equilibrium outcomes within a duopoly framework. Specifically, investor owned firms and cooperatives are analyzed in a closed market setting where these firms may coexist in the economy. The conditions under which ownership structure matters are identified. We conclude that ownership structure matters if the cost of quality at farm level is fixed or if there is a variable cost exhibiting non-constant returns to scale. Two farm level cost functions, a fixed cost function that is increasing and convex in quality, and a variable cost function that is increasing and convex in quantity are analyzed. The two processing firms play a two-stage game where each of the firms produces either high or low quality goods. In the first stage they decide the level of quality to produce, and in the second stage they compete in prices. In the case of a fixed cost function only cooperatives consider the costs incurred at farm level in the first stage of the game. Hence, investor owned firms produce higher levels of qualities at lower prices and generates a larger consumer surplus than cooperatives. The high quality market share is constant in all scenarios. In the case of a variable cost function at farm level, the cooperative has a cost advantage, as the investor owned processor has to pay farm level marginal cost for all farm inputs. It is found that cooperatives generate higher levels and larger quantities of the high quality good at lower prices. This results in higher profits and a larger market share of the high quality good. The cooperative structure also generates a larger consumer surplus and a higher total welfare than the investor owned structure.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This paper has been elaborated in an effort to set the basis for a research on a semi-collective production cooperative program in Panama.

Three aspects are considered to be important when studying the program:  the internal organization of the semi-collective cooperatives to be analyzed; the role of the government in promoting and supporting the program; and the efficiency in the use of resources that the new type of agricultural organization will bring.  Thus, these are the elements on which the present proposal emphasizes.

A general explanation of the program to be analyzed is presented in Chapter II, section C.  Due to some difficulties regarding the sources of information, a very detailed explanation about the nature of the program is not included in the proposal.  The omitted information is mostly related to the specific way in which the semi-collective cooperatives are internally organized and the specific governmental policies regarding the program.  Therefore, the questionnaires presented in this proposal are considered to be tentative and subject to modification once a complete and detailed picture of all the aspects of the program is obtained.  The questionnaires presented at this time are based, mainly, on the ideas and facts obtained through the overall Latin American experience presented in Chapter I.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[New Generation Cooperatives have emerged as a contemporary means for farmers to invest in further processing activities.  This paper considers real options as the basis for evaluating producer investment in a start-up cooperative that involves technological uncertainty. The investment and risk inherent in producer membership in an NGC is analyzed using real options theory logic.  Real options theory has recently been extended to technology positioning projects and how the extent of uncertainty influences the value of a technology "option".  Conventional net present value formulas have been shown to be limited when the conditions of the investment require substantial commitment under uncertainty, such as investments in technology. 

Implications for producers are drawn from the analysis.  Producers always have the alternative of not investing in the initial start-up but waiting and buying in at a later time, perhaps when less uncertainty prevails. Results indicate that producers are better able to evaluate investment in a NGC using real options.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The United States Congress recently passed a law that creates an alternative to individual transferable quota (ITQ) management. The American Fisheries Act promises the ability to rationalize one of the world's largest fisheries, the North Pacific pollock fishery, without the overt appearance of allocating permanent property rights to a public resource. The Act enabled pollock fishers to form cooperative bargaining units that are guaranteed a fixed share of the total allowable catch (TAC) providing they deliver to historic processors. This paper explores the evolution of that policy change and the innovative use of fishery cooperatives to advance voluntary decapitalization and rationalization that Congress intended to benefit both vessels and processors. Game theory offers insights into the likelihood of achieving congressional intent. It is argued that while the Act is Pareto improving, it may violate the legislative intent of win-win rationalization and may introduce a market failure while attempting to rid the fishery of the open-access externality.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Recent recognition of this fact has helped focus on changes or institutional innovations which might reach out to the small farmer.

To formulate a mix of policies capable of serving small farmers, it is useful to review the structure of those organizations which supply credit in Thailand, with emphasis on comparative data for the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) and commercial banks.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The presence of the marketing co-op is shown to result in increased producer prices and welfare gains for all farmers, members and non-members of the co-op. The effect of the marketing co-op on process innovation activity depends on the relative quality of its final products, the degree of producer heterogeneity, and the size of innovation costs.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Since March 1999 the two largest dairy cooperatives of Denmark, MD FOODS and KLOVER MAELK have merged after a long relationship ranging from joint ventures (such as the P-AMBA and M-AMBA companies) to various alleged price wars. We point out that the main reasons for merger from the point of view of MD FOODS were: (i) to establish monopoly power on the domestic market, (ii) to pursue an international growth strategy, (iii) to exploit rationality and coordination gains in the operations. Further, the merger counters the threat of (iv) an alleged foreign take-over of KLOVER, (v) further pressure by the Danish Competition Authority, and (vi) the increased concentration through mergers taking place in the dairy and retail industries in Europe. The post-merger period exhibits some signs of price increases, mainly in the fermented milk market, whereas the price of fresh milk is still to catch up. Questions still remain as to the long term implications of the merger: Will the retailers react by importing milk and dairy products from Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden or elsewhere? General questions still remain as to the governance problems in large cooperative organisations. Relations between farmer-members and management went through a critical test. Since MD FOODS is now openly flirting with yet another merger, this time with Swedish ARLA, these problems may perpetuate. In addition, it is not certain whether this time they will overcome as easily as they have up to now European and national anti-trust regulation.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The paper examines the impact of local institutions on development and poverty in the rural areas of India. Recent research on the role of institutions on the path of economic development indicates the importance of both "macro" and "micro" institutions including local institutions. The study finds a large number of both formal and informal local institutions in the surveyed villages, and a substantial degree of interaction of the households with the institutions. These include both formal institutions such as service cooperatives and dairy cooperatives, as well as informal institutions such as savings groups, community associations and labour groups. The study finds that apart from the standard factors included such as land, capital and labour, the presence and membership in local institutions plays a significant role in explaining the variation in household incomes and gain in capital assets over time. Savings/ micro-credit groups, and dairy cooperatives are found to be particularly important. Further, membership in these institutions is not found to be related to high asset levels or high caste - it is often inversely so. This indicates a stronger developmental role. Recorded opinions of the households supports the findings on the impact and beneficial role of local institutions. The study confirms that institutions do matter, and that local institutions can and do make a significant contribution in helping development in the rural areas, especially so for the lower income groups.]]></dcterms:abstract>

First, the inherent interdependencies in financial intermediation are addressed since they have historically inhibited the efficient functioning of rural financial markets. Second, the meaning of "successful" microfinancial intermediation is defined and applied to two case studies of the most widely recognized "success stories" - the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives in Thailand, and the Bank Rakyat Indonesia's Village Unit system in Indonesia. Third, lessons from the case studies are drawn to identify minimum sufficient organizational (micro) and environmental (macro) conditions necessary for "successful" microfinancial intermediation in rural areas. Finally, the internal operational and external governmental policy implications of these minimum sufficient conditions are analyzed.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The redirection responded to criticisms by the General Accounting Office of past allocations of branded products export promotion funds to large, experienced exporters. This study uses a firm-level analysis to examine whether firm size and export experience matter in how effectively firms use the promotion funds to increase their revenues. The results support neither the GAO criticisms nor the recent program redirection.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Farm restructuring has resulted in a broad range of farm types, such as co-operatives, partnerships, individual farms and combinations of them.  The fact that household resources are allocated into different organization modes is attributed to the utility maximization strategy of heterogeneous agents deriving income from uncertain sources in the face of absent or imperfect factor markets.  Empirical results from a multinomial logit model estimated with data from two-year nation-wide survey of Romanian rural households support the hypothesis that the current agrarian structure is primarily determined by both the human capital characteristics of and economic risks faced by the households.]]></dcterms:abstract>

This paper uses data envelopment analysis and stochastic production frontier models to examine effects of the AFA on the fishing capacity, technical harvesting efficiency (TE), and capacity utilization (CU) of pollock catcher-processors. Results from multi-input, multi-output models indicate that fishing capacity fell by more than 30% and that harvesting TE and CU measures increased relative to past years. This work provides examples of how existing data, which is currently devoid of operator costs and provides only general indicators of earnings, may be used to analyze changes in elements of fleet and vessel performance in response to management actions.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This article examines how the raw milk marketing system in Kenya has evolved after the dairy sector liberalization in 1992 by using panel data of 874 rural households. From the 1998 to 2004, the proportion of rural households who sold milk increased from 37 to 51 percent. During the same period, the number of households who sold milk to traders tripled, while it has drastically declined for dairy cooperatives and a parastatal processing company. The price analysis indicates that the excess supply in localities does not affect the farm gate price received by milk producer in 1998, but not in 2004. This is because trading a perishable commodity, such as milk, over a long distance requires reliable market channels and it takes some time for such supporting market institutions to be established.]]></dcterms:abstract>

We argue that new cooperative organizational models differ in the way ownership rights are assigned to the economic agents tied contractually to the firm  members, patrons, and investors.

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The existing social and institutional structures at the village level are so occupied with immediate issues of survival that they have been unable to divert much of their energy to long term development goals.  The situation is characterized by the existence of "social traps" which lead people to adopt short term solutions and ignore the long term consequences of their actions.  At such low income levels future expected returns are also likely to be discounted at very high rates.
It is a reflection of the state of affairs that very little new land was brought under cultivation since independence.  Individually, the farmers lacked the resources which could enable them to develop new land.  The opening of the Karakorum highway has created new economic opportunities.  Technical inputs such as chemical fertilizer, improved seed varieties and other mechanical technologies are now available.  However, to fully exploit these new opportunities, there is a need for additional inputs such as:  new institutional arrangements, productive physical infrastructure at the village level, credit, reliable transport facilities and investment in human capital.  This process required long term planning, large capital outlays and the need to work with the government.
One program which is helping in this development is the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP).  AKRSP identified the problem as one which needed a restructuring of economic incentives, increasing village productivity, providing crucial inputs and creating a village cooperative.  Its underlying premise is that the creation of a broad-based, self-reliant and development oriented institution at the village level can help address the complex issues of development in the area.
The objectives of this study are classified as the following:  (1) to examine how the village organizations established by AKRSP work in practice; (2) identify functions which the village organization can undertake successfully; (3) identify factors which will contribute to the increased effectiveness of these structures and (4) assess the sustainability of these cooperatives at the local and regional levels.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The agriculture in transition countries can be described by considerable uncertainties.
In these countries public institutions are ineffective in ensuring contract enforcement.
The absence of enforceable contract to set up any kind of vertical co-ordination has
become difficult. In addition, this creates severe barriers for price discovery involving
high transaction costs to co-ordinate market exchanges. Although there is a wealth of
literature on marketing cooperative, but research on their role in transition agriculture
is scarce. This paper tries to contribute to this gap. In this paper we have analysed the
potential benefits and costs of the marketing cooperatives in Hungary employing
transaction cost economics framework. The results presented add to a small literature
on the marketing cooperatives in transition agriculture. We found that the quantity,
the existence of contract, flexibility and trust are the most important factor for farmers
to selling their product via cooperative. The cluster analysis provides some additional
insights regarding farmers' choices. Namely, direct benefits including price, input
finance extension services and speed of payments from cooperative membership have
also important role. The most striking result is that the diversification and reputation
has positive influences on the share of cooperative. Furthermore, large farmers have
less willingness to sell their product to the cooperative. Surprisingly, asset specificity
has rather negative effects on the share of cooperative.]]></dcterms:abstract>

An evaluation of enhancing income and employment generation and environmental externalities due to plantations on wastelands through cooperatives and self-help groups was done. The development process was set up in leased degraded lands in three north Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The capacity building processes like savings and micro-enterprise skills empowered resource-poor farmers. An internal rate of return of 11.5 to 17.0 % in the phase I of the project imply tangible economic benefits at the end of 17 years, which improved to 13.9 to 20.4 % by including environmental benefits like carbon sequestration, soil conservation, soil salinity reclamation, etc. By extrapolating the trend till the end of 30 years, the estimated IRR increased further. The incremental net return due to afforestation of wastelands ranged between Rs. 2283 and 9514 (US $51 -211) ha-1 yr -1 over the pre-developed status. The organization of stakeholders through cooperative societies for developing plantations on degraded lands and managing them for deriving benefits has demonstrated the viability of these models. The model can be replicated by dovetailing the same with the government schemes like food-for work programme and the recently enacted national rural employment guarantee programme.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This report identifies a research and policy agenda that can contribute to rural development and antipoverty initiatives during the 1990s.  It integrates a discussion of private initiatives for rural development into a broader discussion of the issues.  Two theories of underdevelopment and poverty, one motivational and the other structural, serve as a basis for defining quite different research and policy agendas.  To provide some closure of these divergent approaches, it is argued herein that economists must more rigorously examine the philosophical and political economic foundations of their theories.  One reason this is needed is that recent contributions to the theory of public choice rehabilitate the classical economic argument for minimal state action.  An effective and efficient rural development policy, moreover, must analyze the distribution system that delivers goods and services to rural communities.  There is evidence that noncompetitive distribution channels distort prices in some rural communities and transfer wealth from them.  In addition, many rural communities are at the end of distribution channels.  Therefore, even in competitively structured channels, the relatively high costs of delivered goods and services for productive activity and consumption retard economic development and standards of living.  Changes in the structure of rural households and the employment shift out of agriculture limit the ability of rural families to offset these higher costs via traditional household production activities.  Cooperatives of many types-agricultural, rural electric and telephone, wholesale grocery, and consumer cooperatives-have been a major component in market-oriented public policies to promote effective distribution of goods and services to rural America.  More recent institutional innovations that enhance private initiatives are public venture capital funds and nonprofit agencies.  Research on rural distribution channels and the appropriate mix of private and public initiatives should be a major component of any new rural development policy.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Structural changes in the U.S. dairy industry from the early 1980s to the late 1990s included familiar increases in concentration, industry adjustments to serve large supermarkets, the emergence of two national fluid milk firms (Suiza Foods and Dean Foods), and the emergence of two national dairy cooperatives (Dairy Farmers of America and Land O'Lakes, Inc.).  Shifts in the location of milk production in the U.S. to the Western states have caused new dairy product manufacturing plants to locate in those states.  This development promises to intensify battles over market share in the expanding U.S. cheese market between Western firms and Upper Midwestern firms.  Foreign direct investment in the U.S. dairy industry--especially by European Union firms and a large Canadian firm--increased during the 1980s and 1990s.  Facing challenges to expand dairy exports or shrink, the U.S. dairy industry probably will gravitate toward the latter unless government price support and trade policies change to increase price incentives for U.S. firms to export dairy products.]]></dcterms:abstract>

livestock including dairy cattle and milk for many years in Turkey. Until the year 1950, agricultural support system was organized according to genetically
improvement, animal illnesses and veterinary services. Nowadays, agricultural support composition has changed. Milk incentive premium is one of the supports
given to producers to achieve high quality level for milk. The idea behind this premium was to provide well organized milk distribution channel from producers to modern enterprises. In this study, producers who receive milk
incentive premium were chosen for face to face survey in Antalya province. It was examined from the study if premium system is accomplished through the idea. The secondary outcomes of the research were to determine the influence of the premium on producers attitudes, income level, product quantity, as well as membership tendency for cooperatives or unions.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The redirection was, in part, a response to reports by the General Accounting Office that were critical of past allocations of export promotion funds to large, experienced exporters.  This study uses a firm level analysis to examine firms' effectiveness in using Market Promotion Program (MPP, which is now the MAP) funds to increase revenues.  Whereas point estimates suggested that smaller firms were more effective in translating MPP funds into increased revenue than larger firms, these point estimates for small firms were statistically indistinguishable from zero.  In contrast, large firms showed an increase in revenue of greater than one dollar for every dollar of MPP funds.  Further, the revenue increase was statistically significant.  Thus, the firm level analysis supports neither the GAO hypotheses nor the recent program changes.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[There are many reasons for the evolution of super-farms in some of the CIS. This paper does not intend to elaborate on the whole set of reasons. There are already many studies which provide surveys on the background and the rationale of these organisations. This paper aims at focusing on one specific determinant of the rise of super-large farms, namely institutions. The focus is chosen as this determinant seems to have been overlooked, partly because it is completely beyond the neoclassical approach. Institutions as rules of the game can be classified into four levels according to Williamson. The paper mainly deals with embedded institutions. It is shown that these institutions are country-specific and vary widely across countries. It is argued that the evolution of super-large farms could only arise because cooperative and corporate farms survived up to bankruptcy and because embedded institutions impeded the foundation of family farms. Mental models of policy makers did contribute to the amalgation of corporate and cooperatives into super-large farms. However, it is noted that embedded institutions had such strong effects because markets did not work adequately and legislation and its enforcement was not supportive for the foundation of family farms. The paper ends with an evaluation from the economic point of view of the existence of super-large farms and with a projection of what may happen in the future.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Both export taxes and import tariffs are used as policy tools to regulate cotton markets.  Domestic price support programs, water subsidies, fertilizer subsidies, and credit subsidies have also been used as domestic policy tools.  These types of subsidies are not uncommon among developing countries.  This paper provides empirical estimates of the degree of economic inefficiency associated with government intervention in Turkish cotton markets.  A two-region partial equilibrium model of cotton exports and imports is developed under the "small country assumption" to obtain empirical estimates of the deadweight welfare loss associated with these government subsidies.  Although government intervention results in significant income distribution among the various cotton sectors within Turkey, the overall economic inefficiency of the redistribution is very low.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The traditional organization of the hog-pork subsector, characterized by independent hog production and open market coordination, is being challenged as never before.  Rapid growth of large, industrialized production firms with close ties to processors in non-traditional areas such as North Carolina and Colorado indicate the need for change in traditional systems in the Midwest if these producers and communities are to continue to participate in the hog- pork subsector.  Given that few, if any, traditional producers have the capital to attain minimum cost size for a complete production system that fully uses new more efficient technology, some means to coordinate production and marketing of a number of producers will be required.  Cooperative coordination of the production and marketing of independent producers is one alternative to achieve and capture for producers the additional returns from a coordinated system.  This discussion describes and evaluates alternative models of cooperative coordination in the hog-pork chain.  These models were obtained by interviewing executives from selected cooperatives and other leaders who are involved in the hog-pork industry in Europe and the U.S.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Research on trust now forms a prominent part of the research agenda in history and the social sciences. Although this research has generated useful insights, the idea of trust has been used so widely and loosely that it risks creating more confusion than clarity. This essay argues that to the extent that scholars have a clear idea of what trust actually means, the concept is, at least for economic questions, superfluous: the useful parts of the idea of trust are implicit in older notions of information and the ability to impose sanctions. I trust you in a transaction because of what I know about you, and because of what I can have done to you should you cheat me. This observation does not obviate what many scholars intend, which is to embed economic action within a framework that recognizes informal institutions and social ties. I illustrate the argument using three examples drawn from an area where trust has been seen as critical: credit for poor people.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This paper focuses on fisheries management systems as a motivation factor for market-oriented value adding (MOVA). Analytically, the paper relies on the marketing and industrial economics literature. It shows how established fisheries management systems reduce motivation for market-oriented value adding (MOVA) and thereby waste resource rent. An improved management model is introduced which motivates MOVA, cost-efficiency, sustainability, and fair social allocation. This model combines a Seasonal Quota Auction (SQA) and administrative allocation of licenses and quotas to communities or fisher groups. This model offers the following advantages in comparison with a pure Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) model: (i) increases resource rent without privatizing the fish resources to a few private holders; (ii) leases seasonal quotas instead of selling permanent quotas as with ITQ; (iii) improves rent generation by motivating the most market-oriented and efficient fishers by leasing quotas on credit; and (iv) offers the choice of collecting resource rent through fisher's cooperatives, regions, ITQ owners, government, or redistribution of rent as a bonus to all fishers.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[One of the main trends emerging from the agroindustrialization process is the rise of 'grades and standards' (G&S) in food products.  G&S were initially developed by the public sector to reduce transaction costs and ensure product quality and safety but have become a strategic instrument of competition in differentiated product markets (Reardon et al, 2001).   Firms are using grades and standards to protect and develop brands in the international marketplace and in some cases to fill in for missing public standards.  While producers in developed countries have the resources to meet these requirements, in developing countries these changes have tended to exclude small firms and farmers from participating in market growth, because of the implied investment requirements (Reardon et al, 2001).  This is leading to already disadvantaged farmers in these countries being forced to produce basic subsistence food crops and become further excluded from the opportunity to join the global food industry.  
While past research has evaluated the effects and trends of G&S (Reardon, et al, 2001; Farina & Reardon, 2000; Reardon & Farina, 2002) the organizational structure to enable small farmers to meet these requirements has largely been overlooked.  In this paper we use a theoretical contract enforcement framework to argue that private enforcement capital developed through the facilitation of an external aid agency can be an effective means for creating credible and sustainable relationships capable of meeting G&S.  We draw upon theory from Cocks and Gow (2002), Oliver and Gow (2002) and Gow et al. (2000) to argue that in situations characterized by high discount rates and low reputation or trust levels (such as transition agriculture) that the use of a third party external enforcement agent can be used to provide the necessary linkage between the parties to facilitate transactions.   Through the facilitation role of the external agency, private enforcement capital is developed between the firm and the farmers, opening the path for a sustainable mutually beneficial relationship.
Empirical evidence is provided by the case of the United States Department of Agriculture Marketing Assistance Project (USDA MAP) in Armenia and its role in establishing farmer owned milk marketing cooperatives.  By acting as an external facilitator in the initial establishment and ongoing development of milk supply cooperatives the USDA MAP has provided a solution to the dual market failure problems of reliable supply of the consistent quality of milk required by processors while enabling farmers access to markets and ensuring timely payment and therefore enabling farmers and firms to credibly contract for the collective marketing of their milk.  Through the establishment of a unique and flexibly designed combination of leadership development, training in governance, financial management, dairy management, and quality improvement programs, the USDA MAP has assisted the groups in expanding the self enforcing range in such a manner that the cooperative should be capable of sustaining long term credible exchange relationships once the external agency withdraws.  This is important as aid programs have often failed at ensuring sustainability once external management and financial support is removed.   Data for this paper was collected through a series of semi-structured interview with USDA MAP staff, dairy processing firm managers, cooperative managers, and cooperative presidents during the fall of 2002, and over a two week period in March, 2003.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Soil erosion is an important contributor to the agricultural decline, poverty, and emigration which characterize rural Haiti today.  The numerous soil conservation projects have often ignored indigenous knowledge, techniques and socio-cultural institutions and have not generally resulted in sustained conservation.  Limited adoption rates have supported widespread assumptions that peasants were noncooperative, individualistic actors who required substantial external incentives for changing land use behavior.  An alternate strategy was utilized in Maissade, Haiti, where peasants now cooperate to treat small, multiple-owner watersheds.  Field research was conducted to understand the cooperative action and the socio-economic factors associated with participation ("e.g." cooperation) and defection.
Study results indicate that approximately one-half of watershed landholders participate, and a majority of labor is contributed by persons who do not own land in the watersheds.  Participants also regularly treat nonparticipant land, and land tenure status is independent of both landholder participation and structure placement.  Indicators of landholder exposure to trans-boundary erosion and the potential to economically benefit are associated with participation while the realization of a direct benefit is not.  Landholder wealth status is independent of participation though landholders are significantly more wealthy than non- watershed participants.  Participation is also strongly associated with membership in farmer cooperatives and labor exchange groups, and the previous adoption soil conservation innovations.  The findings challenge conventional wisdom concerning peasant behavior in Haiti and also suggest that support of indigenous cooperative institutions can facilitate the treatment of common environmental problems.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Based on the analytical framework of the structure-conduct-performance paradigm of the theory of industrial organisation, the paper analyses those economic conditions that determine the degree of competitiveness in the Latvian dairy and milling industry. The analysis is based on information from milk and grain processing enterprises acquired through a survey carried out at the beginning of 1998. It is shown that the development of market conditions and market behaviour in the sectors examined has in general progressed. Privatisation in both sectors has been completed. While in the dairy sector the majority of processing enterprises were privatised as co-operatives, in the milling industry all enterprises have become closed joint-stock companies. Since the legal status of a co-operative has turned out to be quite problematic for enterprise restructuring, more and more dairy enterprises have started to change into joint-stock companies. Competition in the investigated processing sectors can be considered as functioning. However, in the dairy sector tendencies of stronger horizontal concentration can be observed. The majority of enterprises react in quite an active way to the market conditions. Procurement and marketing channels have been diversified, and considerable investments have been undertaken. Further investments, however, are impeded by high interest rates for credits. As for performance, quite a considerable differentiation between the enterprises in the considered branches could be shown. The main problems seen by the processors are the saturation of the domestic Latvian market, the lack of investment funds, the unstable legislation, the absence of any substantial support from the government, and, in the dairy sector, the low quality of the raw milk.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Agricultural industries in small geographical areas with limited acreage tend to be overlooked by those not associated with the growing region or industry.  Sugarbeets continue to be produced in a relatively small geographic area and on relatively limited acreage in Minnesota, North Dakota, and eastern Montana.  These factors, along with continued debate over policies affecting domestic sugar industries and recent industry expansions, help justify a continued assessment of the economic importance of the sugarbeet industry to the regional economy.

Revenues from sugarbeet production and expenditures by processors to Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana entities in fiscal 2003 represented the direct economic impacts from the industry.  Expenditure information was provided by sugarbeet processing and marketing cooperatives.  Secondary economic impacts were estimated using input-output analysis.

The sugarbeet industry, which included the growing regions and processing plants located in the Red River Valley, west central Minnesota, and northwestern North Dakota/northeastern Montana, planted 776,348 acres and processed 14.5 million tons of sugarbeets in 2003.  Production and processing activities generated $1.1 billion in direct economic impacts.  Gross business volume (direct and secondary effects) from the sugarbeet industry was estimated at $3.1 billion.  Direct and secondary employment in the industry was 2,628 and 29,258 full-time equivalent jobs, respectively.  State-level tax revenues generated by the industry in the tri-state region were estimated at $62.6 million.

In real terms, gross business volume of the sugarbeet industry in Minnesota and eastern  North Dakota has increased 76 percent since 1987.  Increases in business activity from the industry have resulted from increased production, processing, and marketing activities.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Fishermen who compete for a resource in an open access setting generally do not share information amongst each other about where stocks are located.  On the other hand, in fisheries where there are established property rights or fishing cooperatives, fishermen tend to share information with each other.  Recent work in developing spatial models of fishermen behavior has generally ignored the effect that sharing information about where stocks are located can have.  We develop a behavioral model of search amongst spatial resource harvesters that allows for varying degrees of information sharing.  We demonstrate that informational cascades may lead to extremely inefficient spatial search by fishermen that do not share information and that this inefficiency may be persistent over time.  We define a new parameter, information-dependent catchability, which captures the degree to which information sharing improves the efficiency of spatial search.  We argue that institutions change the incentives to share information; information-dependent catchability will differ within a fishery depending on the specific management institutions adopted.  This leads to theoretical predictions which depart from standard models but account for a wider range of field observations.  In particular, we derive the conditions under which closing access to a fishery would have such a drastic impact on the incentives to share information (and hence, the efficiency of search) that total effort in the fishery will be unaffected by restricting access.  We derive the equivalent conditions for steady state harvest and stock levels.  Furthermore, we make an important distinction between Property Rights Rents and Information Sharing Rents (economic rents that can be attributed solely to changes in information-sharing).  The shiroebi shrimp fishery in Shinminato, Japan provides an ideal natural experiment to test the impact of information sharing.  Field observations from this fishery strongly accord with the predictions of the model presented in this paper.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Despite significant progress in recent years, horizontal and vertical integration of the Lithuanian milk sector is not very much advanced. The primary sector is characterised by small-scale farming, the fragmentation of farmland and a low number of livestock per farms. These features cause severe problems regarding the restructuring and modernisation of agricultural production since only a few farmers possess the capital resources to conduct necessary investments. However, despite the unfavourable conditions Lithuanian milk producers have made significant improvements concerning milk quality. In the last decade, the processing sector was due to drastic concentration processes. These were induced by the strong competition processes on the milk market and fostered by foreign direct investors. Today, the market is dominated by three companies. About ten enterprises supply almost the entire market of dairy products. The main mode of governance in the market for raw milk is contractual arrangements. The spot market of strong vertical control are unimportant. The basic rules of the contracts like duration or payment scheme are set by the Ministry of Agriculture, others, especially prices, are negotiated individually between farmer and processor. Because of advantages in terms of transport and transaction costs processors provide better conditions to large agricultural producers. Often the processors try to strengthen their relationships with large-scale producers by providing credits for farm modernisation and/or foodstuff. Most small producers do not deliver directly to processors but to milk collection centres. In general, these are owned by processors. So far, only a few farmers co-operatives have been established in order to take this function. Contractual arrangements also dominate in the distribution channel. Small processors supply mainly to wholesalers who supply the retail market. Large processors often circumvent the wholesale stage and supply the retail stage directly. The basic means which allow this forward integration are intensive marketing activities which are intended to improve the consumer perception of their products. However, this type of exchange is mainly observed in urban areas where well established large retail chains exist. The Lithuanian milk sector is highly internationally competitive. The expansion to international markets is in the responsibility of the individual firms. However, the Lithuanian government and the food processors have established a joint marketing agency that provides infrastructure and joint marketing for international trade..]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Farmers continue to be interested in opportunities for value added production through further processing. New Generation Cooperatives (NGCs) offer member commitment through up-front capital contributions on the part of members. For a potential start-up NGC, one of new and novel issues that face the management of an NGC is making project commitments against the total capital available, both equity and debt capital. Because of the up-front capital commitment by members, NGCs invite managers to make commitments in phases, rather than one initial go or no-go decision. Thus, the capital decision is complex and requires managerial vision in terms of an uncertain world beset by constant shifts in prices, interest rates, consumer tastes, and technology. This paper considers a novel means of evaluating this investment decision, one that encompasses risk components mentioned above. When the outcome of an investment is least certain, real options analysis has the greatest potential analytic value. As time goes by and prospects for an underlying investment become clearer, the value of an option diminishes. The methodology of real options is novel because it encourages managers, at time t, to weigh equally all imaginable alternatives, good and bad. A project's net present value (NPV) is simply the difference between the project's value and its cost. By definition of the NPV rule, managers should accept all projects with a net present value greater than zero. The distinction between real options and conventional decision-making arises in that the standard net present value rule does not take into account managerial flexibility over time. Flexibility is especially important when the project involves sunk cost investments that can never be retrieved. Typically, investment in a new processing facility is a sunk cost, once the decision is made to build the facility. The analysis herein examines a NGC for corn tortilla chip processing, comparing both conventional NPV and real options analyses. PowerSim, a dynamic simulation model, is used is the analysis.

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[ABSTRACT Social capital is defined as the shared knowledge, trust, and culture, embodied in the structural forms of networks and other stable inter-agent relationships. Social capital has been shown to be more difficult to build than economic capital, and to have greater beneficial effects for community as a whole. The relevance of the social capital concept for transitional agenda is explained by the increasing responsibility of private collective action and grass-roots decisions in managing the business activities in agriculture, since this is required by the more democratic foundations of the market economy. Different forms of business organisations are shown to be differentially but consistently associated with social capital, with the major social capital dependent organisational form being the cooperative. The growing complexity of inter-agent relations (particularly in transitional context) causes the increasing amount of economic responsibility being transferred from authority-based to social capital-based forms of economic organisation, i.e. from markets and hierarchies, based mainly on economic capital, to networks with their primary accent on social capital. The social capital-based organisation in agriculture is particularly important in view of its industry-specific limitations and is represented mainly by cooperatives and farmers' associations. The optimal role of the government is to invest in social capital in order to enable rural communities to solve their problems by means of private collective action (self-organisation), rather than attempt to substitute the latter.

<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[ Sozialkapital wird definiert als geteiltes Wissen, Vertrauen und gemeinsame Kultur, eingebettet in Netzwerkstrukturen und andere stabile Beziehungen zwischen Agenten. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass Sozialkapital schwieriger aufzubauen ist als ökonomisches Kapital und dass es größere Auswirkungen auf die Gemeinschaft als Ganzes hat. Die Relevanz des Sozialkapital-Konzeptes für die Agenda der Transformationsländer wird erklärt durch die wachsende Verantwortung von privaten, kollektiven Handlungen und Basisentscheidungen beim landwirtschaftlichen Betriebsmanagement, wie es für die demokratischen Strukturen der Marktwirtschaft erforderlich ist. Verschiedene Betriebsformen sind unterschiedlich, jedoch durchweg verbunden mit Sozialkapital. Die landwirtschaftlichen Produktionsgenossen-schaften erweisen sich dabei als am meisten abhängig von Sozialkapital. Die wachsende Komplexität der Inter-Agenten-Beziehungen (insbesondere im Kontext des Transformations-prozesses) bewirkt, dass ein steigender Anteil ökonomischer Verantwortung von autoritäts-basierten zu sozialkapital-basierten Organisationsformen übergeht, d. h. von Märkten und Hierarchien, die vor allem auf ökonomischen Kapital basieren, zu Netzwerken mit dem Schwerpunkt auf Sozialkapital. Die sozialkapitalbasierten Organisationen in der Landwirt-schaft werden hauptsächlich durch Genossenschaften und Bauernverbände repräsentiert und sind besonders wichtig in Hinblick auf ihre industriespezifischen Beschränkungen. Politische Maßnahmen sollten Investitionen in Sozialkapital unterstützen, um ländliche Gemeinden zu befähigen, ihre Probleme durch private, kollektive Handlungen (Selbstorganisation) zu lösen, anstatt zu versuchen, diese zu ersetzen.]]></dcterms:abstract>

	<dc:description><dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Since their inception, Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) crab fisheries have attracted participants willing to undertake great financial and personal risks to participate in these high valued fisheries. Although entry to the fisheries is limited, excess capital and overcapacity, together with stock declines, have resulted in a race for fish. The shortest season is in the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery, which has been prosecuted for less than one week in recent years. Efforts of managers to protect declining stocks by reducing allowable catch have increased the economic stress on participants and communities that depend on these fisheries and increased pressure on participants to take greater risks. 

For several years, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council worked with participants to address these problems in the crab fisheries through series of working groups and management measures. In 2001, Congress stepped in, directing the Council to assess various rationalization  programs for the fisheries, including individual fishing quotas (IFQs), processor shares, cooperatives, and quotas held by communities. The outcome of the Council process is a new and unique management program selected by a unanimous vote of the North Pacific Council. The program reflects the Council's desire to accommodate the interests of several groups dependent on these fisheries-vessel owners, processors, captains and crew, and communities. Under the program, harvest quota shares (QS) will be issued to vessel owners and captains. Processors will be issued processing quota shares. Under these allocations, 90 percent of harvest quota shares are designated for delivery to holders of processing quota shares. Community interests are protected by a requirement that a certain portion of the catch be landed and processed in designated regions. An arbitration program is included to resolve price disputes, which could arise because of the constraints on markets created by the dual share allocations. The result of the Council's action is one of the most complex fishery management programs to date. The attempt to satisfy many interests creates significant hurdles that must be overcome for the program to succeed economically and environmentally. 

This paper describes key dimensions of the proposed crab fishery management program and identifies the most substantial hurdles that the program must overcome for the Council to judge it a successful management program for the fisheries. First, managers will be challenged by program implementation. Implementation will require initial allocations of harvesting shares to vessel owners and captains and processing shares to processors. Most shares will be regionally designated based on the participant's landings history. Second, managers will face the challenge of protecting stocks as the incentives to high grade increase in the share-based fishery. Third, the markets for the harvest shares, captains shares, and processing shares must develop in a manner that facilitates coordination of harvesting and processing activity required by the share system and the regional landing and processing requirements. Lastly, market opportunities for harvest landings will be constrained by the requirement that deliveries be made to a processing share holder in a designated region. For the program to be considered a success, price formation in the market for landings must be perceived as fair. Each of these issues is described in a manner that provides the reader with a perspective of the institutional challenges faced by a program that attempts to address the concerns of several different interests. In addition, characteristics of the fisheries that contribute to the potential to overcome these obstacles are discussed.]]></dcterms:abstract>
